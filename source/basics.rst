    ├── models/
    ├── sdk/
    ├── config.yaml
    ├── main.py

* ``models/`` contains the downloaded models to be used in the project.
* ``sdk/`` contains essential tools and resources tailored for the project's development needs. For more details, refer to the :doc:`Development <development>` page.
* ``config.yaml`` centralizes application settings, enabling user customization for behavior and AI model selection. For more details, refer to the :doc:`Configuration Reference <config-yaml>` page.
* ``main.py`` **???**
